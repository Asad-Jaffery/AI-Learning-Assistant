## ⚠️ Note on App Performance and AI Features

Since the app is hosted on Render’s free tier, the backend and frontend may take a moment to **“wake up”** after being idle.

- **Cold start:** When you first open the app, it might take a little time to fully boot.  
- **AI functionality:** Calls to the AI may occasionally be slow or temporarily fail due to free tier limits.

**I Recommend:**

1. Open the app and try using an AI feature.  
2. If it doesn’t respond immediately, give it a minute and try again.  
3. Once it’s awake, features should work normally.

Thank you for your patience! 🙏
