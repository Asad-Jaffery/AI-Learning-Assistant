- since I'm using the free tier, you may have to wait before the app boots up. Also, the AI functionality might be buggy, or take a while. I would reccomend trying to spin it up, use an AI feature, and if it does not work, wait and then try again.




## ⚠️ Note on App Performance and AI Features

Since the app is hosted on Render’s free tier, the backend and frontend may take a moment to **“wake up”** after being idle.

- **Cold start:** When you first open the app, it might take a little time to fully boot.  
- **AI functionality:** Calls to the AI may occasionally be slow or temporarily fail due to free tier limits.

**I Recommend:**

1. Open the app and try using an AI feature.  
2. If it doesn’t respond immediately, give it a minute and try again.  
3. Once it’s awake, features should work normally.

Thank you for your patience! 🙏
